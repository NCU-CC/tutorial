# WEB-SECURITY

If we use `HTTP` in web site instead of `HTTPS`, users may get malicious content.

If we make a web service without `SQL Injection` protection, attackers may take whatever they want from database.

If we make a web page without `XSS` protection, user's browser may execute dangerous code.

If we don't protect server from `CSRF` attack, user's credential may be used by the attacker.

All web developers should care about security issues of web technology !!!
