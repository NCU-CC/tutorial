## Version-Control
Version Control System has become the most important technique today.
If you always write codes in a 1 person team, then this may not work for you.
But if you are working in a huge team, it may be a nightmare without version control system.

Version Control System provides a way for users to work distributedly.
Users can write their own code and merge them into one in a simple way.

These are famous version control tools :
- **GIT**
- CVS
- SVN

A good solution is using one central version control server and everyone works on it!

## Version-Control-Example
- Track all commits
- Return to any commit in history
- Provide a way to work together and distributedly
